# Diet-Recommendation-System


## :scroll: General info
### Model developement
The recommendation engine is built using Nearest Neighbors alogrithm which is an unsupervised learner for implementing neighbor searches. It acts as a uniform interface to three different nearest neighbors algorithms: BallTree, KDTree, and a brute-force algorithm based on routines in sklearn.metrics.pairwise. For our case, we used the brute-force algorithm using cosine similarity due to its fast computation for small datasets.

### Dataset
I used Food.com kaggle dataset Data with over 500,000 recipes and 1,400,000 reviews from Food.com. Visit this [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews?select=recipes.csv) link for more details.
### Backend Developement
The application is built using the FastAPI framework, which allows for the creation of fast and efficient web APIs. When a user makes a request to the API (user data,nutrition data...) the model is used to generate a list of recommended food similar/suitable to his request (data) which are then returned to the user via the API.

### Frontend Developement

The application's front-end is made with Streamlit. Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps to create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc. For our case the front-end is composed of three web pages. The main page is Hello.py which is a welcoming page used to introduce you to my project. The side bar on the left allows the user to navigate too the automatic diet recommendation page and the custom food recommendation page. In the diet recommendation page the user can fill information about his age,weight,height.. and gets a diet recommendation based on his information. Besides, the custom food recommendation allows the user to specify more his food preferency using nutritional values.


PS: You should have docker and docker-compose already installed
### Use the hosted version on Streamlit Cloud
